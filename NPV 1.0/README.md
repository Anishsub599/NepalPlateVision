# Nepal Plate Vision Project

## Abstract

The **Nepal Plate Vision** project aims to address the challenges of efficient and accurate license plate recognition in the context of modern transportation and security needs. By harnessing the power of advanced computer vision techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optical character recognition (OCR), the project seeks to develop a robust system capable of analyzing license plates on vehicles.

### Project Objectives

The project's primary objectives include:

- Improving accuracy in license plate recognition.
- Enabling efficient tracking of vehicles at different checkpoints.
- Leveraging machine learning models and real-time video feeds for license plate recognition.
- Marking the time of vehicle passage for traffic analysis, law enforcement, parking management, toll collection, and enhanced security.

### Motivation

This endeavor aligns with the motivation to explore machine learning technologies and contribute to the local context. With the proposed graphical user interface (GUI) and machine learning model, the system strives to enhance transportation management and security within Nepal.

### Expected Outcomes

The project's expected outcomes include:

- Achieving high accuracy rates in license plate recognition.
- Optimizing traffic management through real-time data analysis.
- Offering insights for urban planning based on traffic patterns.

Through diligent research, technological innovation, and collaboration, this project aspires to make significant advancements in the field of license plate recognition, benefiting both transportation technology and security infrastructure.
